**Feedback is more than apreciated** although it should be taked into account that this is mainly a test/side project from my CS assigments on swing components.
Low effort code is expected and almost no OOP design patterns are applied.

This is was inspired by @RumbleMike and couldn't be done without @Henrik-3 simple Valorant API. Kudos to them.
